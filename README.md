# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
#### The purpose of this assignment was to use VBA to analyze financial data for a particular set of stocks and their historical performance. We were helping Steve figure out if his parents were making a sound investment using a series of macros to retrieve information and synthesize it. We used loops, for loops, nested loops, msg boxes, and conditionals to achieve this. 
## Results
#### Although the majority of the stocks performed well in 2017, most except 2 performed very badly, reporting severe losses for investors. If Steve's parents are kean on investing in this field, they should only consider investments in ENPH or in RUN.
## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Refactoring code makes data easier to understand and the code easier to sort through, but is also very time consuming and so one must compare the quality versus quantity of what you're putting out when refacoring code. Because it can be subject to many errors, there are many tests that must be run and fixed. I encountered a bug I was not able to fix when refactoring my code. It took me a long time and many message boxes to figure out what was wrong, and then once I did, there was another bug that I couldn't find the source to. The ending results didn't reveal too much more except that 2017 wasn't a great year either. THe advice to Steve's parents wouldn't have changed.
